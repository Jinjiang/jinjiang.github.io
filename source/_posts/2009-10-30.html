<p>I download Ubuntu 910 Operating System at the first time.<br />
<br />
Just as the news said, U910 updates the loading screen, and shows mail icon, im icon, bluetooth icon, network icon and sound volumn icon etc in a smart place. That's very convenient for me.<br />
<br />
And then, I installed Firebug in Firefox, QQ for Linux & Google Chrome for Linux. All of them are my indispensable applications. I'm writing this post in Google Chrome for Linux.<br />
<br />
Pity that I havn't install any Chinese input method yet. So just an English post here.</p>
